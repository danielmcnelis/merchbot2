The other day, I tried to summon a Magician of Faith I banished for Chaos Sorcerer. Everything has become Giant Rex to me. There are no other decks, no monster types other than Dinosaur. The only spell I know how to activate is Fossil Dig. Occasionally I don't draw Giant Rex, and I cry a little. I attack for game but wish I was being gamed instead. It's become a joke of sorts, or maybe it's just my life. I can't go anywhere without seeing Giant Rex. I went to pet my dog the other night, but instead of rubbing her belly I banished her to boost Evilswarm Salamandra by 300. I had to put her down. I sit in the corner now counting down the days, the days where we shall see sweet release from this torment, the day when forged was about creating decks from the random cards you pull from packs. Those days are long gone. I have seen God, and I have seen the devil, but they are one and the same. I stared into the abyss and screamed, and it screamed back: \"summon rex?\"",
